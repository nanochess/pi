This is a simple program to calculate the PI digits. It can be
run as a COM file or put into a boot sector of a floppy disk to be
run.

It's compatible with 8088 (the original IBM PC), and it will take
a lot of time on a real hardware! ;)

If you want to assemble it, you must download the Netwide Assembler
(nasm) from www.nasm.us

Use this command line:

  nasm -f bin pi.asm -Dcom_file=1 -o pi.com
  nasm -f bin pi.asm -Dcom_file=0 -o pi.img

Tested with VirtualBox for Mac OS X running Windows XP running this
game, it also works with DosBox and probably with qemu:

  qemu-system-x86_64 -fda invaders.img

Enjoy it!
